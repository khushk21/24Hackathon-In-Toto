The theme for International Women's day 2020 is #EachforEqual but the question we need to ask ourselves is how far have we come from #BalancedForBetter? According to the campaign for this year, "Equality is not a women's issue, it's a business issue. Gender equality is essential for economies and communities to thrive." In recent times, resumes that contain the word "women's" such as "women's chess club captain" have been penalized by different AI used by companies. Our approach to this issue is developing a platform on which employees can input their data for a particular company to review. This platform does not ask you to specify your gender, and it eliminates the possibility of the employer being able to identify the gender of the person applying, through including identification measures that are not revealing. Therefore, the interview would be given to the candidate purely based on merit and qualifications of the person in question. Current hiring practices ask you for your last-drawn salary, which is already lower in the case of women, therefore perpetuating the existing wage gap. This platform tackles the problem of gender wage gap in Singapore which is at 6% (women receive 6% lower for the same jobs as men) at 2020 according to MoM, by not asking you to input your previous salary, thereby making the process much fairer and unbiased.
